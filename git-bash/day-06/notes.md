# Day 06 — Environment Awareness & Automation (Git Bash)

## What is an Environment?
An environment defines how the system finds and runs programs using PATH variables.

## Why PATH Matters
If PATH is misconfigured, commands like python, pip, git will fail.

## Commands Learned
- which python
- python3 --version
- pip3 list
- echo $PATH

## Key Learning
Most errors are environment issues, not code issues.

## Real-World Insight
Always verify environment before debugging code.
